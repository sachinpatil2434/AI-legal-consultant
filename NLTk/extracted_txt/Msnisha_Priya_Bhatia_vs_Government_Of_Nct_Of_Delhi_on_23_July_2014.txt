 2.       The appellant is present.   The Public Authority is represented by Mr. S.P. Ja
Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences, GNCTD, Delhi. 
FACTS
3.      This is a story of prolonged struggle by appellant, who knocked the doors of almost 
every forum for justice, perhaps out of compulsion. The appellant was a senior officer at  prestigious
  department,   R&AW(Research   and   Analysis   Wing)   alleging   a   raw   deal   in 
several matters. The petitions and complaints by appellant contain serious allegations that 
kicked up conflicts and slapping of criminal cases by and against her.   While she was 
charged with attempt to commit suicide under Section 309 of IPC, she charged senior  officers   with
  criminal   defamation   under   Section   499,   500   of   IPC.   She   made   several 
complaints including sexual harassment against which an inquiry was conducted where  the  
charges   could   not   be   proved   for   want   of   evidence,   while   the   enquiry   committee 
observed violation of guidelines prescribed by Supreme Court in Vishaka & Ors Vs State 
Of Rajasthan & Ors., pertaining to procedure and constitution of inquiry etc. The appellant 
was referred to Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences GNCTD by the Delhi 
High Court, which she strongly believes to be great injustice happened to her as she was 
detained there for almost a month, leaving sad experience of torture and harassment to 
her and her aged parents. Detailed report by medical board consisting of several expert 
doctors did not find any mental disorder or any major illness in her but observed that 'it 
also cannot be said that there is no mental health problem at all'. It is significant to note  that   the  
medical   board   noted   her   cooperative   attitude   in   the   hospital.   She   alleged   a 
deliberate conspiracy and attempt to depict her as mentally sick person just because she 
filed several complaints, which were necessitated out of compelling circumstances, the 
truth or otherwise of which, this Commission cannot go into. She claimed that because 
she was not sick, the detention there was illegal and if she is really sick she should be 
treated and not punished like that. 
4.        The question before the Commission is limited, that is − Whether appellant has  right   to  
information   and   access   to   her   own   medical   record   that   is   held   by 
respondent institute. In view of the background briefed above, she is in dire need of the  medical  
records   to  tell   the   world   that   she   was   not   mentally   sick   but   fit   and   also   for 
defending her case before the appropriate forum. 
5.          Through  RTI  application dated 11−8−2011,  the appellant,  Ms. Nisha Priya  Bhatia is 
seeking   information   regarding     her   'illegal   detention'   in   the   chronic   patients'   ward   of  
the  respondent   Institute, under the garb   and on the pretext of a medical check up from the 
evening of 20−1−2011 to 18−2−2011 and sought the following:−
(i) Certified and paginated copy of the Appellant's entire case file;
(ii) Certified copies of all correspondence/reports/commentaries exchanged 
between the various doctors at IHBAS concerning the Applicant;

(iii) Certified copies of documents containing all entries - including daily diet

the nurses in the chronic patients'  ward where the Applicant was detained  from the evening of 20−
01−11 to the afternoon of 18.02.11;
(iv) Certified copies of all correspondence exchanged by IHBAS with any court 
of law, including the Delhi High Court, or any government agency, including 
the R&AW or the PMO or the Cabinet Secretariat, Rashtrapati  Bhawan,  concerning the Applicant;
(v) Certified copies of all official and legal documents' alleged to have been 
m a d e  a v a i l a b l e  b y  t h e  A p p l i c a n t  t o  t h e  t e a m  o f  d o c t o r s  o f  I H B A S  -  ( R e f .  
para 1 on page 1 of 3 of the report of medical board which met on  23.02.11). 
6.           Appellant during hearing submitted that R&AW(Research and Analysis Wing) is an 
organization where its nature of working requires everything to be kept secret and nothing is 
known to others, these iron walls of secrecy allow no junior officer to raise his/her voice 
against the high−handed actions and insults of the Senior officers.  Appellant also stated that: 
"As I questioned, my career was being spoiled by branding me as mentally unsound and was 
forcefully sent to the respondent institution. In such hospital there will be no scope for any 
escape   or   rescue   or   remedy   until   officers   themselves   change   their   mind

discharge".    She also said that at the time of 'treatment' she was holding a high position as a 
director of an Institute, where she was teaching/training the candidates for R&AW (Research 
and Analysis Wing) in the Cabinet Secretariat.  According to her statement, her superiors got 
antagonized   against   her   for   no   reason,   started   withdrawing   her   privileges

gradually and ultimately her chair was also removed leaving her with no place to sit and work. 
She strongly believes that if she gets the information she sought, their actions would be 
exposed.  
7.     The PIO claimed via letter dated 15−9−2011 that the information sought was exempted 
under section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act as disclosure would impede the process of investigation. 
FAA vide his order dated 18−10−2011 upheld the PIO's order and disposed of her first appeal, 
stating   that   she   was   absent   during   the   said   hearing   also.     The   appellant,   therefore, 
approached the Commission by way of 2nd  appeal. On the other hand, the respondent/PIO 
personally sought adjournment to facilitate his Director/FAA to attend after returning to India 
on 28th June, 2014, from his foreign tour and defend.   
8. PIO   during   the   hearing   submitted   that   his   predecessor   PIO   sought   exemption 
under section 8(1)(h) which states that "if the information sought by the appellant,   would 
impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders" the same  can  be 
denied,  as the case of  the  appellant   is  also  related to the on−going department  enquiry.     He

cited   an   order   of   CIC   in   No.CIC/SG/A/2011/002238/16606   dated   27.12.11   in 
appeal filed by Mrs Rashmi Dixit Matiman at IHBAS wherein the denial of information by 
IHBAS on the ground of fiduciary relationship under 8(1)(e) was not accepted. In the writ 
petition by IHBAS the Delhi High Court passed an interim order allowing exemption and the 
hearing   is   still   pending.   The   PIO   claimed   the   matter   was   sub−judice.   The   PIO   further 
contended as follows: 
"IHBAS would also like to make a reference to another similar case wherein a RTI application 
and appeal was filed by Mrs. Rashmi Dixit Matiman at IHBAS which was duly replied by 
IHBAS vide letter dated 29−4−11 and subsequent order of FAA, IHBAS dated 1−6−

that the information sought by the applicant is sensitive/confidential in nature and falls under 
the purview of section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act.  The FAA, IHBAS upheld  "that in a psychiatry 
case - the medical records were not only physical clinical examination but included various 
information shared by the relatives particularly spouse, children, parents etc. the fiduciary 
relationship in psychiatry cases extends not only to the patient but also to the information 
shared   by   others.     Information   provided   by   each   of   the   informants   to   any
  of   the   team  members   of   a   mental   health   team,   should   be   considered   as  
h a v i n g    b e e n    p r o v i d e d    i n    a  
fiduciary relationship, therefore, Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act is applicable."  Thereafter, the 
appellant   approached   the   CIC   against   the   order   of   FAA,   IHBAS   and   CIC  
announced   its  verdict in No.CIC/SG/A/2011/002238/16606 on 27−12−
1 1  w i t h  t h e  d i r e c t i o n  t h a t  " T h e  A p p e a l  i s  
allowed.  The PIO is directed to provide the complete information as per records on queries 
1, 3, 4, 8 and 9 to the Appellant before 20th January, 2012"
IHBAS   felt   that   the   decision   of   CIC   was   to   be   re−looked   taking   into   consideration  
the  involvement of important issues of privacy, affordable public policy and psychiatric practice, 
which may affect larger public interest as a precedent.  It therefore became obligatory on the 
part of IHBAS in the case to approach Hon'ble High Court of Delhi against the decision of  CIC  
dated   27−12−2011.     Hon'ble   High   Court   of   Delhi   passed   an   order   on   26−3−2012 
"Exemption allowed, subject to all just exceptions".  The matter has been adjourned for 29−8−
14 and the interim order granted by Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has been made to continue.  The  
case   of   Ms.   Rashmit   Dixit   against   the   decision   of   CIC   is   sub−judice   and   the 
implementation of the decision of CIC will be subject to outcome of Civil Writ Petition filed in 
the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi."
9.  With   regard   to   the   submission   of   the   PIO,   in   the   case   referred 
[CIC/SG/A/2011/002238/16606], the appellant had claimed that she was forcibly admitted by 
her husband without informing her what ailments she was suffering from, and alleged that she 
was hospitalized only to terrorize her and certify as mentally ill.  First Appellate Authority in 
that case claimed that information about her condition was obtained from different sources 
which included her husband and therefore the information was held in a fiduciary capacity by 
the doctors. The FAA's order was rejected by the Commission which directed furnishing of 
Msnisha Priya Bhatia vs Government Of Nct Of Delhi on 23 July, 2014

information to the appellant.   The Commission considered the   submission and holds 
that the CIC decision and interim order of Delhi Court had no relevance to this case, 
because the grounds claimed are different i.e., in this case they invoked section 8(1)
(h) and in the other it was 8(1)(e). 
10. As to the submission of the appellant that there is on−going departmental enquiry 
for denial of information,  the PIO chose not to give details of enquiry and how long it would 
go, what was the charge and stage and how the disclosure would interfere or hamper or 
impede the investigation or prosecution. 
 
11.       In view of the above the issues before the Commission are:
A) Whether appellant has right to information about her own medical records? B)
Whether appellant's case fall under provision of life and liberty? C)
Whether information sought can be denied under Section 8(1)(h) of RTI Act?
12.      As part of the first issue, we need to refer to provisions of Consumer Protection Act,  1986   to 
ascertain   whether   appellant   has   the   right   to  information   about   her   own  medical  record. 
(A)  Right to information under RTI and Consumer Protection Act:  
Expression   "Consumer''   is   defined   in   the   Consumer   Protection   Act,   1986:
 S 2(1) 
(d) "consumer" means any person who, −(i) omitted
(ii) hires (or avails of) any services for a consideration which has been paid or 
promised  or   partly  paid  and  partly   promised,   or  under  any  system  of

payment and includes any beneficiary of such services other than the person who 
hires (or avails of) the service for consideration paid or promised, or partly paid  and  
partly   promised,   or   under   any   system   of   deferred   payment,   when   such 
services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person,
Similarly as per Section 2(1)(o) : "service" means - 
" service of   any   description   which   is   made   available   to   the   potential   users  
a

includes the provision of facilities in connection with banking, financing, insurance,

other information, but does not include rendering of any service free of charge or 
under a contract of personal service."
In a landmark judgment in Indian Medical Association Vs. V.P Shantha [1995(6) SCALE 
273] Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has   stated   that   "Service"   rendered   by   Medical 
Practitioner were covered under Consumer Protection Act. Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down:
(1) Service rendered   to   a   patient   by   a medical practitioner   (except   where   the 
doctor renders service free of charge to every patient or under a contract of 
personal service),   by   way   of   consultation,   diagnosis   and   treatment,   both 
medicinal and surgical, would fall within the ambit of 'service' as defined in 
Section 2(1)(o) of the Act.
......
(10)  Service rendered   at   a   Government   hospital/health   center/dispensary   where 
services are rendered on payment of charges and also rendered free of charge  to   other   persons  
a v a i l i n g    s u c h  s e r v i c e s  w o u l d    f a l l    w i t h i n    t h e    a m b i t    o f    t h e  
expression 'service' as defined in Section 2(1)(o) of the Act irrespective of the 
fact that the service is rendered free of charge to persons who do not pay for  such service.  
Free service would   also   be   "service"   and   the   recipient   a  "consumer" under the Act.
(11)  Service rendered   by   a medical practitioner   or   hospital/nursing   home   cannot  be  
regarded   as service rendered   free   of   charge,   if   the   person   availing   the  service has   taken  
an   insurance   policy   for medical care   where   under   the  charges   for   consultation,   diagnosis  
a n d  m e d i c a l  t r e a t m e n t    a r e    b o r n e    b y    t h e  
insurance company and such service would fall within the ambit of 'service' as 
defined in Section 2(1)(o) of the Act.
(12)  Similarly, where, as a part of the conditions of service, the employer bears the  expenses  
o f  m e d i c a l  t r e a t m e n t    o f    a n    e m p l o y e e    a n d    h i s    f a m i l y    m e m b e r s  
dependent on him, the service rendered to such an employee and his family 
members by a medical practitioner or a hospital/nursing home would not be 
free of charge and would constitute 'service' under Section 2(1)(o) of the Act." Thus,   the   appellant  
is   a   consumer   in   her   capacity   as   'patient'   as   per   the   definition   of 
Consumer under Consumer Protection Act 1986 and according to Supreme Court's landmark 
judgment in IMA vs Shantha, the medical services are 'services' under that Act. 
Therefore, the Appellant has right to information and treating institution has a legal duty to 
give proper information, not to give misleading information and not to resort to unfair trade 
practices. 
      The relevant provisions of Consumer Protection Act vide respect to Right to information are −
         Section 6 of CPA: Objects of the Central Council:−  The   objects   of   the   Central   Council  
shall   be   to   promote   and   protect   the   rights   of   the  consumers such as−

Ozair Husain Vs Union of India [  AIR 2003 Delhi 103],  the bench of   A D Singh, M  Mudgal   held  
that   consumer   had   right   to   information   about   the   product.   In   this   PIL   the 
petitioner sought a direction to disclose voluntarily as to whether food product that is being 
sold contains elements from animals or not.   In this case the relationship between Right to 
Information and freedom of expression was discussed. The bench said: 
"freedom of expression enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) can serve two broad   purposes −

made of animals including birds and fresh water or marine animals or eggs, and (2) it can 
help   him   to   fulfilll   his   belief   or   opinion   in   vegetarianism".   Article   10   of

Convention on Human Rights provides that everyone has a right to freedom of expression 
and this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive information and ideas 
without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. Article 19(1) and 19(2) 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declares that every one shall 
have the right to hold opinions without interference, and every one shall have the right to 
freedom of expression, and this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information of ideas of all kinds regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in 
the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. It needs to be noted that India is a 
signatory to the aforesaid convention..... Right to hold opinions and to receive information 
and ideas without interference embodied in the Covenant is concomitant to the right to 
freedom of speech and expression which includes right to free flow of information. Since 
ancient times we have allowed noble thoughts to come from all sides [Rig Veda]. This has 
helped in forming, building, strengthening, nurturing, replenishing and recreating opinions 
and beliefs of an individual...... Reading Article 19(1)(a) along with the Covenant, it must 
be recognised that right to freedom of speech and expression includes freedom to seek, 
receive and impart information of ideas. It seems to us that freedom to hold opinions, ideas, 
beliefs   and   freedom   of   thought,   etc.,   which   is   also   enshrined   in   Preamble
  to   the  Constitution, is part of freedom of speech and expression.
20. It appears to us that where packages of food products, drugs and cosmetics do not 
disclose any information in writing and by an appropriate symbol about the composition of 
the products contained therein, right to freedom of conscience of the consumers is violated 
as   they   may   be   unconsciously   consuming   a   product   against   their   faiths,  
beliefs   and  opinions.
21. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the view that it is the fundamental right of 
the consumers to know whether the food products, cosmetics and drugs of non−

(a), 21 and 25 of the Constitution.

23. In so far as food products are concerned, adequate provisions have been made for  informing  
the  consumers   as  to  whether  or not  the   article   of  food   is  vegetarian   or  non−
vegetarian. As regards drugs and cosmetics, necessary amendments have not been made 
in the relevant statutes. In so far as a life saving drug is concerned, there is a view point 
that the information: whether or not it is derived or manufactured, wholly or partly, from an 
animal, should not be disclosed since it is meant to fight disease and save life
25. Till such time the requisite amendments are carried out, we direct as under:−
(1) Where a cosmetic or a drug other than life saving drug, as the case may be, contains 
ingredients of non−vegetarian origin, the package shall  carry  label bearing the following 
symbol in red colour on the principal display panel just close in proximity to name or brand

Thus, as sought by the petitioner, the division bench of Delhi High Court gave   following 
directions: (i) to protect the rights of innocent conscientious consumers who object to the 
use of animals in whole or in part or their derivatives in food, cosmetics and drugs, etc., by 
making the manufacturers and packers thereof to disclose the ingredients of the aforesaid 
products so that they make an informed choice with regard to their consumption; (ii) to the 
manufacturers and packers of cosmetics, drugs and articles of food for complete and full 
disclosure of the ingredients of their products being sold to consumers; (iii) a declaration 
that the consumers have a right of making an informed choice between the products made  or  
derived   from   animal   and   non−animal   ingredients;   and   (iv)   a   direction   to   the 
manufacturers   and   packers   of   food,   cosmetic   and   drugs   that   the   products   made   from 
animals   should   bear   an   easily   identifiable   symbol   conveying   that   it   has   an   animal 
ingredient. "
The above judgment deals with right to information to exercise their choices and 
beliefs   under   Consumer   Protection   Act.   Extending   this   principle   derived  
from  Articles 21 and 19 of our Constitution, a consumer of medical services too has a 
right   to   know   what   treatment   was   given   to   him/her,   what   were   the  
r
e
p
o
r
t
s
 
 
 
o
f
 
diagnostic tests, what were the opinions expressed by doctors or specialists, why 
he/she was kept in hospital etc. Consumer's right to information extends both to the 
products and services, including medical service.

Council Act, 1956 (102 of 1956), by the Medical Council of India, with the previous approval 
of the Central Government, relating to the Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics for 
registered medical practitioners, namely:− Maintenance of Medical Records: 
1.3.1. Every physician shall maintain the medical records pertaining to his/her 
indoor patients for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the 
treatment in a standard proforma laid down by the Medical Council of India and 
attached as Appendix 3. 
1.3.2.  If   any   request   is   made   for   medical   records   either   by   the 
patients/authorised attendant or legal authorities involved, the same may 
be duly acknowledged and documents shall be issued within the period of  72 hours.

Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Science and Technology [ILR2004(2)Kerala150] 
had observed that :
".....Appendix   3   referred   to   in   regulations   1.3.1   provides   for   information,  
among   other  things,   pertaining   to   diagnosis,   investigations   advised   with

investigation, and advice. Therefore it is obvious from the appendix that what is to be 
given is the full details about the patient, namely, the findings pertaining to the deceased. 
That is the diagnosis and the periodical advice for treatment. As and when diagnosis is 
made the treatment will be advised by the doctor to the nursing staff in the case sheet 
itself. Therefore the case sheet will show the progressive testing, diagnosis and treatment 
given to the patient. The details to be furnished in Appendix 3 are of comprehensive in 
nature and should contain the diagnosis and treatment given to the patient during the 
period,   the   patient   was   under   treatment.  Regulation   1.3.1   has   to   be   read  
w

regulation 1.3.2 which makes it mandatory that any patient requesting for medical  
records should be furnished copies of "documents" within 72 hours from the date  
of demand. In other words, the patient's right to receive documents pertaining to  
his/her treatment is recognised by the Regulations. The documents referred to in  
Regulation  1.3.2   necessarily   have  to  be   the   entire   case  sheet maintained  in 
the   hospital  which  contains the result of diagnosis and treatment administered, the

  summary of which is provided in Appendix 3. Therefore the petitioner is entitled to  
photocopies of the entire case sheet and the respondents cannot decline to give  
the same by stating that the details are available in Appendix 3 furnished, which  
they are willing to furnish."
Kerala High Court further observed that:
It is also to be noticed that Regulations do not provide any immunity for any medical 
record to be retained by any medical practitioner of the hospital from being given 
to the patient. On the other hand it is expressly provided that a patient should be given 
medical records in Appendix 3 with supporting documents. Therefore in the absence of 
any immunity either under the Regulations or under any other law, the respondent−
Hospital   is   bound   to   give   photocopies   of   the   entire   documents   of   the  
patient.  Standing   counsel   for   the   respondent−Hospital   submitted   that   the  
documents   once  furnished   will   be   used   as   evidence   against   the   hospital  
and   against   the   doctors  concerned.   I   do   not   think   this   apprehension   will  
j u s t i f y    f o r    c l a i m i n g    i m m u n i t y    a g a i n s t  
furnishing the documents. If proper service was rendered in the course of treatment, I 
see no reason why the hospital, or staff, or doctors should be apprehensive of any 
litigation. A patient or victim's relative is entitled to know whether proper medical 
care was rendered to the patient entrusted with the hospital, which will be revealed 
from case sheet and medical records. There should be absolute transparency with 
regard to the treatment of a patient and a patient or victim's relative is entitled to 
get copies of medical records. This is recognized by the Medical Council Regulations 
and  therefore  petitioner is entitled  to have copies  of  the entire medical  records of
 his  daughter which should be furnished in full. 
Case Law as to Right of information of Patients :

establishing the right of patient to information and duty of the Hospitals to provide the same. 
              In Kanaiyalal Ramanlal Trivedi v Dr. Satyanarayan Vishwakarma 1996; 3 CPR 
24 (Guj); I (1997) CPJ 332 (Guj); 1998 CCJ 690 (Guj), the hospital and doctor were held 
guilty of deficiency in service as case records were not produced before the court to refute 
the allegation of a lack of standard care.
            If hospital takes up a plea of record destroyed, it was held that it could be a case of 
negligence.   In  S.A.Quereshi   v   Padode   memorial   Hospital   and   Research   Centre   II 
2000. CPJ 463 (Bhopal) it was held that the plea of destroying the case sheet as per the 
general practice of the hospitals appeared to the court as an attempt to suppress certain  facts  that 
are  likely  to  be  revealed  from  the  case  sheet.   The  opposite  party   was  found 
negligent as he should have retained the case records until the disposal of the complaint.

 Explaining the consequences of denial of medical record, it was held that an 
adverse inference could be drawn from that. In case of Dr. Shyam Kumar v Rameshbhai, 
Harmanbhai Kachiya 2002;1 CPR 320, I (2006) CPJ 16 (NC). The National Commission  said   that  
not   producing   medical   records   to   the   patient   prevents   the   complainant   from 
seeking an expert opinion and it is the duty of the person in possession of the medical 
records to produce it in the court and adverse inference could be drawn for not producing 
the records. 
                On   the   point   of   negligence   AP   state   commission   said   in   case   of  Force   v.   M 
Ganeswara   Rao 1998;3 CPR   251;   1998   (1)   CPJ   413   (AP   SCDRC)   that   there   was 
negligence as the case sheet did not contain a proper history, history of prior treatment and 
investigations, and even the consent papers were missing.
        In V P Shanta v. Cosmopolitan Hospitals (P) Ltd 1997;1 CPR 377 (Kerala SCDRC) 
the State Commission held that failure to deliver X−ray films is deficient service. The patient  and  
his   attendants   were   deprived   of   their   right   to   be   informed   of   the   nature   of   injury 
sustained. 
                     In  Devendra Kantilal Nayak v Dr. Kalyaniben Dhruv Shah 1996;3 CPR 56; I 
(1997) CPJ 103; 1998 CCJ 544 (Guj) the State Commission disbelieved the evidence of the 
surgeon because only photocopies were produced to substantiate the evidence without any

 National Commission in case of  Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research  Centre   v.   Samuraj  
and   Anr.,   I(2005)   CPJ   (NC)   held   that   the   hospital   was   guilty   of  negligence   on   the  
ground   that   the   name   of   the   anesthetist   was   not   mentioned   in   the 
operation notes though anesthesia was administered by two anesthetists. There were two 
progress cards about the same patient on two separate papers that were produced in court.                  
  In  Dr.   Tokugha   Yeptomi   V   Appollo   Hospital   Enterprises   Ltd   and   Anr 
III 1998 CPJ 132 (SC) it was held that not maintaining confidentiality of patient information 
could be an issue of medical negligence. In this case the HIV status of a patient was made 
known to others without the consent of the patient.
      These decisions establish the right of the patient and obligation of hospitals or medical 
institutions to  give medical records. 
                 In  Raghunath Raheja v Maharashtra  Medical  Council, AIR 1996 Bom 198, 
Bombay High Court upheld the right of patient to medical record very emphatically. Judges 
M Shah and A Savanth stated: 
"We are of the view that when a patient or his near relative demands from the Hospital or 
the doctor the copies of the case papers, it is necessary for the Hospital authorities and 
the doctors concerned to furnish copies of such case papers to the patient or his near 
relative.   In   our   view,   it   would   be   necessary   for   the   Medical   Council   to

necessary directions are given to all the Hospitals and the doctors calling upon then to 
furnish the copies of the case papers and all the relevant documents pertaining to the 
patient   concerned.   The   hospitals   and   the   doctors   may   be   justified,   in

necessary charges for supplying the copies of such documents to the patient or the near 
relative. We, therefore, direct the first respondent Maharashtra Medical Council to issue 
necessary   circulars   in   this   behalf   to   all   the   hospitals   and   doctors   in   the

Maharashtra. We do not think that thet hospitals or the doctors can claim any secrecy! or 
any confidentiality in the matter of copies of the case papers relating to the patient. These 
must   be   made   available   to   him   on   demand,   subject   to   payment   of   usual  
charges.   If  necessary,   the   Medical   Council   may   issue   a   press−note   in   this  
behalf   giving   it   wide  publicity in all the media."
Transformation of ethical norm into right to medical records
16.         Medical ethics internationally is governed by the principle of autonomy, which 
recognizes the rights of individuals to self−determination. Autonomy is rooted in society's 
respect for individuals' ability to make informed decisions about personal matters. It is an 
important social value which has shifted to define medical quality in terms of outcomes  that   are  
important   to   the   patient   rather   than   medical   professionals.   The   respect   for 
autonomy is the basis for informed consent and advance directives.  
17.     The Patients are capable of electing to make their own medical decisions, or can 
delegate decision−making authority to another party. Only if the patient is incapacitated,  laws  
around   the   world   designate   different   processes   for   obtaining   informed   consent, 
typically by having a person appointed by the patient or their next of kin make decisions  for   them.  
Thus   the   value   of   informed   consent   is   closely   related   to   the   values  of autonomy
and truth telling.
18.       The   reason   for   "ethical   conflicts"   in   medical   ethics   is   lack   of communication. 
Communication breakdowns between patients and their healthcare team, between family 
members, or between members of the medical community, can all lead to disagreements  and  
strong   feelings.   These   breakdowns   should   be   remedied,   and   many   apparently 
insurmountable "ethics" problems can be solved with open lines of communication. The 
Patient has to be communicated all the information about his or her medical treatment,  which  is 
now being  recognized  as  a  right  guaranteed  by  various  statutes  rather  than 
leaving it at the level of a mere ethical norm. 
19.         The  UK's Data Protection Act 1998  gives an individual a right of access to 
information held about him. The Access to Health Records Act 1990 gave access to a 
patient's medical records in non−computerized form, while Data Protection Act 1998 Act 
gives access to both electronic and non−electronic records. The 1990 Act is still relevant to 
be in force relating to access to a patient's medical records after his death. 
Msnisha Priya Bhatia vs Government Of Nct Of Delhi on 23 July, 2014
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138743027/

20.     Section 3 of Access to Health Records Act  1990  says that the holder of the 
record, within a maximum period of 40 days, must give access to the record by allowing  the  
applicant   to   inspect   the   record   (or   an   extract)   or   if   the   applicant   so   requires   by 
supplying him with a copy of the record or extract. Where any information     Right under RTI Act :
21.           Under   Section   2(j)   of   the   RTI   Act,   which   defined   'information',   imposes   an 
obligation on the Commission to enforce the right to information available to the appellant 
under any other law. This Commission observes that both the laws− RTI Act and CPA Act 
provided the appellant a strong and undeniable right to information of her own medical  record. 
The   Commission   holds   that   undoubtedly   the   appellant,   being   a   patient   the  appellant  
has   a   right   to   detailed   medical   record   about   her   treatment   under 
S e c t i o n  3  o f  t h e  R T I  A c t  a n d  a l s o  u n d e r  C o n s u m e r  P r o t e c t i o n  A c t ,  1 9 8 6 .  
(B)  Is it   "life and liberty" issue?
22.               Appellant   has   alleged   a   deep   conspiracy   among   certain   top   officers   who 
manipulated to show her as mentally imbalanced person and she was forced into the  Institute   of  
Human   Behaviour   and   Allied   Sciences,   GNCTD,   ''for   her   behavioral 
problems'', against which she was waging legal battles on different aspects, including this  second  
appeal.     Apart   from   this   right,   she   also   has   several   rights   under   Consumer 
Protection Act 1986, including right to information, right to seek remedy against medical 
negligence such as treating her for a disease which she did not suffer from.  
23.     The Commission is concerned with her right to information about medical records, 
treatment, diagnosis, counsel, prescription etc from the time of admission to discharge 
including relevant records pertaining to pre and post hospital stages. If her allegation that 
she was unnecessarily treated in the Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences for 
no reason or for wrongful reasons is proved her stay in hospital could be considered illegal 
detention. This would raise questions of serious violation of right to life and liberty. She 
also claimed that she would be entitled to the information sought within 48 hours under the 
'right to life and liberty' provision of Section 7(1) of RTI Act.   That is why she sought 
medical records of so called treatment meted out to her. It was denied without explaining 
any justification and without substantiating how her petition could not fall under life and 
liberty clause or how exception of 'impeding' investigation would attract.  The   Commission   holds  
t h a t    i n f o r m a t i o n    r e g a r d i n g    m e d i c a l    r e c o r d s    e s p e c i a l l y  
when she is disputing her stay and treatment is concerning life and liberty of the  appellant. 
(C)Whether claim of Sec 8 (1)(h) exception valid?
24.       The Commission then examined the possibility of application of exception under 
Section 8 (1) (h) of RTI Act. Hon'ble Delhi High Court in  [Bhagat Singh Vs. CIC [146 
(2008) DLT 385] explained that the exception under Section 8(1) (h) should not be used to 
deny the right itself: 
Msnisha Priya Bhatia vs Government Of Nct Of Delhi on 23 July, 2014

"Access   to   information,   under   Section 3 of   the   Act,   is   the   rule   and  
exemptions   under  Section 8,   the   exception.   Section 8 being   a   restriction   on  
t h i s    f u n d a m e n t a l    r i g h t ,    m u s t  
therefore is to be strictly construed. It should not be interpreted in manner as to shadow 
the very right itself. Under Section 8, exemption from releasing information is granted if it 
would   impede   the   process   of   investigation   or   the   prosecution   of   the  
offenders.   It   is  apparent   that   the   mere   existence   of   an   investigation  
p r o c e s s   c a n n o t    b e    a    g r o u n d    f o r  
refusal of the information; the authority withholding information must show satisfactory 
reasons   as   to   why   the   release   of   such   information   would   hamper   the  
investigation  process.   Such   reasons   should   be   germane,   and   the   opinion   of

hampered should be reasonable and based on some material. Sans this consideration, 
Section 8(1)(h) and other such provisions would become the haven for dodging demands 
for information. "
In yet another case,  B S Mathur vs Public Information Officer Of Delhi High Court 
[180(2011)DLT303]  the Delhi High Court emphasized on the point of factual interference 
with the investigation to claim this exception under Sec 8 (1)(h), as follows:
"19. The question that arises for consideration has already been formulated in the Court's 
order   dated   21st   April   2011:   Whether   the   disclosure   of   the   information

that   disclosure   of   information   is   the   rule   and   non−disclosure   the  
exception.   A   public  authority   which   seeks   to   withhold   information   available

reproducing of the wording of the statute would not be sufficient when recourse is 
had to Section 8 (1) (h) RTI Act. The burden is on the public authority to show in 
what manner the disclosure of such information would „impedeƒ the investigation. 
Even if one went by the interpretation placed by this Court in W.P. (C) No.7930 of  2009  
[Additional   Commissioner   of   Police   (Crime)   v.   CIC,   decision   dated   30th  November  
2009]   that   the   word   "impede"   would   "mean   anything   which   would 
hamper and interfere with the procedure followed in the investigation and have the 
effect to hold back the progress of investigation", it has still to be demonstrated by  the   public  
authority   that  the  information   if  disclosed  would indeed  "hamper"  or

"interfere" with the investigation, which in this case is the second enquiry"
25.      Thus these two emphatic judgments made it mandatory for the public authority to  show   that
  the   disclosure   of   the   information   would   in   fact,   impede   the   process   of  investigation.  
The   officers   of   Respondent   Authority   told   the   Commission   that   no   such 
investigation was under process. They did not present anything to explain as to how Sec 8 
(1)(h) could be used to deny the information.        
         DECISION  :
26.    The Commission, thus rejects the contention of the respondent authority invoking  exception  
under   Section   8(1)(h)   as   devoid   of   merit   as   they   have   miserably   failed   to  establish   any
  factor   that   would   attract   such   exception.     In   view   of   the   above,   this  Commission   does
  not   accept   the   contention   of   the   respondent   authority   that   the 
information sought by the appellant is exempt under section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act as this  is   with 
reference  to  the   appellant's   life   and    liberty,     who   was     kept   in    detention  by 
the    respondent/institute    and she    has every      right   to   have      the information  
about the treatment meted out to her during her detention in the respondent/institute.  It is 
not third party information. More so, the respondent/institute cannot invoke the ground of 
exemption under section 8(1)(h), as there is no  evidence to show that any inquiry pending  against  
the   appellant.     The   Public   Authority   being   an   Institute/hospital   has   a   legal 
responsibility to share the information about her treatment and medical check up etc.  The 
copies of the correspondence exchanged by the Respondent/institute with other officers 
pertaining to her case, also do not fall under the category of any  exemption, under RTI  Act.   
2 7 .        R e g a r d i n g  t h e  a p p l i c a t i o n  o f  o r d e r  o f  C o m m i s s i o n  ( C I C / S G / A / 2 0 1 1 /
002238/16606 dated 27−11−2011) as contended by appellants,   the Commission finds no  relevance 
to  this   appeal   as   it   was   not   a   dispute  between   spouses   and  that   she  was 
seeking her own medical record and hence   that decision would   not come to rescue of 
respondent, as it has nothing to do with exemption under 8(1)(h).  
28.       Neither the PIO nor the Appellate Authority tried to substantiate points as to how 
the disclosure of her own medical record would hamper the process of investigation. They 
did not even attempt to explain what the charge against her was and what investigation  was  
pending.   An   empty   claim   of   exception   under   section   8(1)(h)   cannot   entitle   the 
authority to refuse the information for which the appellant has right both under Right to 
Information Act, 2005 and Consumer Protection Act 1986. 
29. The Commission is of the view that the patient's right to obtain his medical record  is   not   only  
protected   under   RTI   Act,   but   also   under   the   regulation   of   Indian   Medical  Council,  
which   is   based   on   world   medical   ethics,   and   also   as   a   'consumer'   under 
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as explained above.  It is the duty of the doctor/Hospital to 
develop a mechanism whereby the copy of patients medical record from his joining to his 
discharge be provided to him or his legal representative even without him asking as a

matter of routine procedure at the time of discharge as directed by Bombay High Court in 
above referred case. 
30.         This Commission finds that the practice of the   public authority in relation to the 
exercise of its functions under the RTI Act does not conform with the provisions or spirit of 
the RTI Act as revealed from the defence claimed with casual invocation of Section 8(1)(h) 
exception   to   deny   the   medical   records,   the   Commission   exercising   its   powers   under 
Section   25(5)   of   RTI   Act,   recommends   the   Public   Authority   IHBAS   to   develop   a 
mechanism for disclosure of medical records to patients or his relatives in a time frame 
with proper protection to confidentiality and privacy as ordained by RTI Act, preferably in 
the lines of judgment of Bombay High Court. The Commission recommends that when a 
patient or his near relative demands from the Hospital or the doctor the copies of the case 
papers, it is necessary for the Hospital authorities and the doctors concerned to furnish 
copies of such case papers to the patient or his near relative. As observed by Bombay  High   Court  
it   would   be   necessary   for   the   Medical   Council   to   ensure   that   necessary 
directions are given to all the Hospitals and the doctors calling upon then to furnish the  copies   of  
the   case   papers   and   all   the   relevant   documents   pertaining   to   the   patient  concerned. 
31. The respondent authority/PIO is, therefore, directed to provide certified copies of 
the complete information sought by the appellant in her RTI application dated 11−8−2011 
within 30 days from the date of receipt of this order and  show  cause  why maximum  penalty 
cannot   be  imposed  on  the  then  respondent/PIO  for   taking  excuse  under   non− applicable  
clause   of   the   RTI   Act   and   denying   the   information   to   the   appellant.     His 
explanation should reach the Commission within 3 weeks from the date of receipt of this 
order.  Non−compliance of the Commission's order will be taken as serious deviance of the  RTI Act. 
   If the respondent/PIO is obstructed by his superior officer, from furnishing the 
information to the appellant, such superior officer will be treated as 'deemed PIO' and shall 
be responsible for penal provisions under the RTI Act. 
32. With   regard   to   the   submission   of   the   PIO   that   the   case   be   adjourned,   the 
Commission is of the view that as the present case has already been pending for a long 
time and as the case pertains to the life and liberty of the appellant, who is a woman 
officer, and that no justification has been given by PIO for further delaying it, case need not  be  
adjourned.     As   Mr.   S.P.Jaiswal   was   designated   as   PIO  by   the  respondent/institute 
through whom the Commission has to deal with, and neither the Commission nor the RTI 
Act requires the presence of the Director/FAA, the Commission finds no need to postpone  the case. 
33.     The Commission orders accordingly.
