It is seen from the report that there are lot of improvements to be done for the purpose of improving the water quality in the water bodies. Further, some of the lakes were found to be dry due to the obstructions caused in the inlets and the outlets and due to not making any proper maintenance of the same. 5. It is time and again re-iterated that the water bodies will have to be protected against encroachment and pollution. It has to be properly maintained as it plays a great role as a water storing reservoir during the rainy season and it can be used for several purposes if it is properly maintained or treated and it will help in conserving the aquatic biodiversity and also attract birds. 6. There is a duty cast on the State Government and its departments and its regulators like Pollution control Board and the local bodies to be proactive in implementing the environmental laws in its letter and spirit to protect environment and avoid the water bodies being polluted as there is a constitutional mandate giving them a responsibility to protect the environment as contemplated under Article 48 (A) of Constitution of India and Right to Clean Environment is a part of Right To Life as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. This is being reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as this Tribunal in several matters of similar nature that no water body should be allowed to be encroached by the miscreants so as to reduce its storing capacity as it acts as great role in protecting environment apart from providing water for drinking and irrigation purposes. In spite of all those things, none of the Governments are very much serious about protecting the environment. 7. Further, the photograph produced along with the report submitted by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) show the manner in which the water bodies are maintained and the pathetic conditions under which the water bodies are. 8.

The applicant filed I.A. No.67 of 2020 in O.A. No.115/2016stating that there was violation of the order passed by this Tribunal dated 17.05.2016 in respect of the walkway that has been constructed. There was only a status quo order passed. According to the applicant, this Status Quo order was violated by the concerned department who had constructed the same. So, the authorities are also expected to explain whether after the status quo order passed by the Tribunal in O.A. No.115 of 2016 dated 17.05.2016, any further work has been done in thatCheruvu so as to ascertain the nature of allegation of violation said to have been committed by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. 12. None of the reports filed by the State Departments have touched this aspect. When this was pointed out, the learned counsel appearing for the State of Telangana submitted that they will come with a further report in this regard as well. 13. This interlocutory application [I.A. No.130/2020 in O.A. No.115/2016] was filed by the third party who wants to come on record, as he is also interested in protecting the water body, which is the subject matter in this application. Since the applicant in the original application prosecuting the Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 matter, we do not think that there is any necessity to implead any other person as a party to the proceeding, so as to protect the water as claimed by the applicant in the interlocutory application, after lapse of four years of filing this application. So under such circumstances, there is no necessity to implead the proposed applicant as party to the proceedings and the interlocutory application is dismissed with above observation and I.A. No.130/2020 in O.A. No.115/2016 is disposed of accordingly. 14. This Miscellaneous Application [M.A. No.118/2017 in O.A. No.115/2016] was filed by the applicant for a direction to the respondent to conduct joint inspection of SakhiCheruvu and submit a detailedreport regarding the demarcation and fixation of FTL and buffer zone. Since we have already directed the authorities to submit a detailed report regarding the same, it is not necessary to appoint any joint committee for this purpose. The question of appointing the joint committee only arises, if the official respondents did not file any proper report regarding the same. So under such circumstances, there is no necessity to appoint a Joint Committee at this stage and the M.A. No.118/2017 in O.A. No.115/2016 is disposed of accordingly. 15. This interlocutory application [I.A. No.38/2019 in O.A. No.156/2016] was filed by some third parties who want to come on record as respondents to 78 to 103 on the ground that certain actions are being taken against them. This Tribunal has no jurisdiction to go into the question of right or title of the property etc. The aggrieved persons who are affected by the action taken by the authorities are at liberty to challenge the same before the appropriate forum and this Tribunal is not entitled to go into the title dispute and as such, there is no necessity to implead the applicants in I.A. No.38/2019 as claimed by them. So, this application is dismissed with liberty to those persons to challenge the action taken by the authorities before the appropriate forum in accordance with law. With the above observations and directions, this interlocutory application [I.A. No.38/2019 in O.A. No.156/2016] is disposed of. 16. The concerned authorities are directed to file their respective reports as directed by this Tribunal in both the cases on or before 28.10.2021 by e-filing in the form of Searchable PDF/OCR Supportable PDF and not in the form of Image PDF along with necessary hardcopies to be produced as per Rules.\" 11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. Final consideration of the matter and orders 12. The issue which is to be dealt with is the need for preventing and remedying pollution of the water bodies and preventing and removing encroachments which in terms of public trust doctrine requires constant watch and remedial action as an act of good governance. There appears to be unfortunate neglect of such public duties on the part of the statutory and administrative authorities as shown by the admitted factual position about the status of 19 water bodies, inspected by the State Board,quoted in detail in orders dated 27.05.5021 and 08.09.2021.This is also breach of judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jagpal Singh, supra. There can be no dispute about the ecological significance of the role of such water bodies.Apart from acting as storing reservoir during rainy Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 season and conserving aquatic bio- diversity,they add to asthetics and help recharge ground water among other environmental functions. 13. The matter has also been dealt with by the Tribunal vide order dated 18.11.2020 in Original Application No. 325/2015, Lt. Col. Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi v. Union of India & Ors., and directions applicable PAN India have been issued for control of pollution and removal of encroachments in the water bodies in the light of judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as follows: \"8. Accordingly, a consolidated report has been filed by the CPCB on 29.10.2020 in two parts. Part A deals with the aspect of plans for restoration of water bodies and status of their execution while part B deals with the status of compliance of direction relating to water harvesting. The CPCB report points out the need for making a proper and centralized inventory of water bodies, and assessment of their water quality; the absence of a single nodal agency to oversee the management of restoration of polluted water bodies, and water harvesting; and recommends that the relevant Central Ministries, especially MoJS, play an increased and major role in implementation and oversight. 9. We first consider part A of the report. It mentions that 24 States mentioned therein have provided information on the subject which has been compiled in Table 1 and 2 as follows:- \"Based on the information received from the States/UTs, State-wise status on Ponds, Lakes and Restoration of Water Bodies, State-wise Status on lnventorisation, Geo-Tagging, UIN Allocation, Water Quality Assessment, Action Plans for Restoration of Water Bodies Pond compiled and presented at Table 1 and Table 2 below.

The CPCB has observed that the information given by the States/UTs was not scientific. Proper inventories were required to be made. Water quality was required to be monitored. Instead of different departments dealing with the issue, single agency was required to be set up as a nodal agency for restoration of all water bodies in the States/UTs. It was also necessary to constitute Wetland Authority in every State/UT as per Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. The said authority can be given responsibility for restoration of water bodies or a separate body for the purpose can be set up on a pattern of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram. The Ministry of Jal Shakti can provide assistance in the light of programmes undertaken by the Government of India like AMRUT, Smart City, MGNREGA and other programmes. 11. It will be appropriate to reproduce the observations and suggestions of the CPCB:- \"2.5 Observations and suggestions of CPCB \u0192 23 States & 4 UTs have provided information as per the format circulated by CPCB. \u0192 Based on the information received from the States/UTs, there are Lakes- 2,080 ( 11 States and 2 UTs), Ponds- 1,69,523 ( 13 States and 4 UTs), Tanks- 1,699 (1 State), Others like pynes, aahars, reservoirs etc. - 1,51,440 (3 States), Total number of water bodies identified as - 4, 13,911 (25 States and 6 UTs), Total number of identified water bodies selected for restoration- 1,32,080 (17 States and 02 UTs), Total number of identified water bodies already restored- 3, 20,903 (13 States and 3 UTs), Total number of identified water bodies presently under restoration- 40,543 (14 States and 2 UTs). {{{{ \u0192 It appears, number of water bodies identified by the States/UTs as Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 reported is not scientific and therefore States/UTs have to carry out proper inventory of water bodies using Geological Survey Maps of India (reconnaissance survey) or using any other available technologies like Remote Sensing. \u0192 For prioritization of all the identified water bodies is possible only after assessment of water quality of all the water bodies. Presently, water quality of water bodies are monitored by the State Water Resources Department/Agricultural Department/Fisheries Department/Public Health Engineering Departments apart from Central Water Commission (CWC), Central Pollution Control Board (under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme). Therefore, all the water bodies to be assessed for water quality for prioritisation and for restoration. Also, there is a need to pool all the water quality data under /NOIA -WRIS Portal under National Water Informatics Centre as it facilitates policy decision. \u0192 Presently, various departments in the States/UTs are custodians of water bodies therefore there is a need that all the States/UTs need to designate a 'single agency' as a nodal agency to ensure restoration of all polluted stagnant water bodies in the respective State/UT in consultation with the concerned departments. Such a nodal agency also may co-ordinate with the respective State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) in the State or Pollution Control Committee (PCC) in the respective UT for ensuring timely compliance to Hon'ble NGT directions in the matter. \u0192 Presently, States Governments /UT Administrations are required to constitute Wetland Authority in the respective States/UTs under the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. The wetland authority may be given responsibility of restoration of water bodies or a nodal agency or a separate body may be designated as done in case of Haryana (Haryana Pond Waste Water Management Authority), Madhya Pradesh (The Environmental Planning and Coordination Organization (EPCO) and Mizoram (Irrigation and Water Resource Department). \u0192 Presently, water bodies are undergoing restoration of water bodies under the various schemes like financial support of Ministry of Jal Shakti or State schemes (like Mission Kakatiya in case of Telangana). Therefore, Ministry of Jal Shakti being nodal Ministry for Water Resources in the country, there is a need to integrate with the programmes such as 'National Lake Conservation Programme, National Wetland Conservation Programme, Ministry of Water Resources Programmes like 'Repair, Renovation & Restoration of Water bodies with Domestic/External Assistance which are undertaken by Government of India, Central Sector Schemes like AMRUT, Smart City, MGNREGA or any other programmes for restoration of water bodies in the country.\" xxx..............................xxx..........................................xxx Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 16. We find that the steps taken so far can hardly be held to be adequate. As already noted, protection of water bodies serves great public purpose and is essential for protection of the environment. It helps not only aesthetics but also water availability, aquatic life, micro climate, recharge of ground water and maintaining e-flow of the rivers. Under the Public Trust Doctrine, the State has to act as trustee of the water bodies to protect them for the public use and enjoyment for current and future generations. We may note the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the subject which are as follows: i. State of T.N. v. Hind Stone, (1981) 2 SCC 205, at page 212: \"6. Rivers, Forests, Minerals and such other resources constitute a nation's natural wealth. These resources are not to be frittered away and exhausted by any one generation. Every generation owes a duty to all succeeding generations to develop and conserve the natural resources of the nation in the best possible way. It is in the interest of mankind. It is in the interest of the nation.\" ii. Hinch Lal Tiwari v. Kamala Devi, (2001) 6 SCC 496, at page 500: \"13. It is important to notice that the material resources of the community like forests, tanks, ponds, hillock, mountain etc. are nature\u0081s bounty. They maintain delicate ecological balance. They need to be protected for a proper and healthy environment which enables people to enjoy a quality life which is the essence of the guaranteed right under Article 21 of the Constitution.\" iii. T.N. GodavarmanThirumulpad v. Union of India, (2002) 10 SCC 606, at page 628: \"......... 33.... As was observed by this Court in M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath our legal system based on English common law includes the public trust doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment. The public at large is the beneficiary of the seashore, running waters, air, forests and ecologically fragile lands. The State as a trustee is under a legal duty to protect the natural resources. These resources meant for public use cannot be converted into private ownership.\" iv. Intellectuals Forum v. State of A.P., (2006) 3 SCC 549, at page 574: \"75. In M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath &Ors. (1997) 1 SCC 388, Kuldip Singh, J., writing for the majority held: \"34. Our legal system... includes the public trust doctrine as part of its jurisprudence. The State is the trustee of all natural resources which are by nature meant for public use and enjoyment.... The State as a trustee is under a legal duty to protect the natural resources.\" Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 76. The Supreme Court of California, in National Audubon Society v. Superior Court of Alpine Country also known as Mono Lake case summed up the substance of the doctrine. The Court said: \"Thus, the public trust is more than an affirmation of State power to use public property for public purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the State to protect the people's common heritage of streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands, surrendering the right only in those rare cases when the abandonment of the right is consistent with the purposes of the trust.\" This is an articulation of the doctrine from the angle of the affirmative duties of the State with regard to public trust. Formulated from a negatory angle, the doctrine does not exactly prohibit the alienation of the property held as a public trust. However, when the State holds a resource that is freely available for the use of the public, it provides for a high degree of judicial scrutiny on any action of the Government, no matter how consistent with the existing legislations, that attempts to restrict such free use. To properly scrutinise such actions of the Government, the courts must make a distinction between the Government's general obligation to act for the public benefit, and the special, more demanding obligation which it may have as a trustee of certain public resources [Joseph L. Sax \"The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law: Effective Judicial Intervention\", Michigan Law Review, Vol. 68, No. 3 (Jan. 1970) pp. 471-566]. According to Prof. Sax, whose article on this subject is considered to be an authority, three types of restrictions on governmental authority are often thought to be imposed by the public trust doctrine [ibid]: 1. the property subject to the trust must not only be used for a public purpose, but it must be held available for use by the general public; 2. the property may not be sold, even for fair cash equivalent; 3. the property must be maintained for particular types of use (i) either traditional uses, or (ii) some uses particular to that form of resources.\" v. Jitendra Singh v. Ministry of Environment &Ors., 2019 SCC Online 1510 pr 20 \"........... 20..... Waterbodies, specifically, are an important source of fishery and much needed potable water. Many areas of this country perennially face a water crisis and access to drinking water is woefully inadequate for most Indians. Allowing such invaluable community resources to be taken over by a few is hence grossly illegal.\" 17. In NGT order dated 27.08.2020 in OA 351/2019, Raja Muzaffar Bhat vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir &Ors., it was observed: \"............. 8. One of the serious challenges is solid and liquid waste management, apart from encroachments. There are binding directions of the Hon\u0081ble Supreme Court in Almitra H. Patel Vs. Union of India Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 &Ors2. and Paryavaran Suraksha vs. Union of India3 on the subject of scientific management of solid waste and sewage/effluents in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, (\u201eWater Act\u0081) Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, (\u201eAir Act) and waste management rules framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (\u201eEP Act\u0081). There is large scale non-compliance of the said statutory provisions which has led this Tribunal to consider the issue of river pollution in OA No. 673/2018, News item published in \"The Hindu\" authored by Shri Jacob Koshy Titled \"More river stretches are now critically polluted: CPCB\" in view of acknowledged data of 351 polluted river stretches in the country. Apart from the said issue, large scale failure has been found in the matter of solid waste management as repeatedly recorded in O.A. No. 606/2018. The Chief Secretaries of all the States/UTs were required to remain present in person before this Tribunal for interaction and further planning. In O.A. No. 325/2015, Lt. Col. Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi v. UOI &Ors., the Tribunal has considered the issue of restoration of water bodies. In Original Application No. 593/2017, Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti &Anr. v. UOI &Ors., the issue of untreated sewage or effluent being discharged in water bodies have been taken up for consideration. There are several other matters dealing with the such issues, including coastal pollution, pollution of industrial clusters etc. 9. There is discussion in the media about inadequacy of monitoring of action for restoration of lakes, wetlands and ponds which is certainly necessary for strengthening the rule of law and protection of public health and environment4. Several directions have been issued by the Hon\u0081ble Supreme Court in M.K. Balakrishnan and Ors. v.

We also note that the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India, Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organization (CPHEEO) has issued an advisory on \"Conservation and Restoration of Water Bodies in Urban Areas\"6 in August, 2013 which need to be followed. The matter was also considered by the Standing Committee on Water Resources (2015-16), Sixteenth Lok Sabha. Its Tenth Report has been published by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation under the heading \"Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies-Encroachment on Water Bodies and Steps Required to Remove the Encroachment and Restore the Water Bodies\"7 in August, 2016. Further, the \"Guidelines for the Scheme on Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies under PMKSY (HKKP)\"8 have been published by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Govt. of India in June, 2017. The said report also provides useful material to be looked into by the enforcement agencies. Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 19. As regards, report of the CPCB on the subject of rain water harvesting, it appears that CPCB has not appreciated the direction of this Tribunal on the subject. While rain water harvesting may be required in all buildings and other places in urban areas, in the present context, the Tribunal has directed setting up of such facilities in sub water sheds along ponds for utilization of surplus rain water for restoration of the ponds which have become dry and for augmenting other ponds. 20. There is, thus, need for continuous planning and monitoring at National, State and District levels. Suggestions and observations of CPCB and the Oversight Committee need to be acted upon. 21. As suggested by the CPCB, a single agency needs to be set up in every State/UTs within one month. This work may either be assigned to the Wetland Authority of the State or the River Rejuvenation Committee or to any other designated authority such as the Secretary, Irrigation and Public Health/Water Resources. It is made clear that if the State Wetland Authority is to be assigned the task of protection of all water bodies, this task will be in addition to the normal functioning of the State Wetland Authority under the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. Such nodal agency must call a preliminary meeting on the subject with all the District Magistrates on or before 31.01.2021 to take stock of the situation and to plan further steps. Thereafter, a regular meeting may be held for periodic monitoring at the District level as well as the State level with the identified targets of proper and scientific identification and protection of all water bodies, assigning unique identification number, removing encroachments, preventing dumping of waste, maintaining water quality and restoration by taking other appropriate steps, involving the Panchayats and the community, utilizing the financial resources available from different sources. Steps taken need to be http://mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/Advisory%20on%20Urban%20Water%20Bodies.pdf http://164.100.47.193/lsscommittee/Water%20Resources/16_Water_Resources_10.pdf http://pmksy-mowr.nic.in/documents/RRR_PMKSY_Guidelines_2017.pdf documented and compiled and reported to a central authority, preferably the CPCB. This Tribunal has already constituted a CMC to be headed by the Secretary, MoJS with the assistance of CPCB and other authorities to monitor remedial action for 351 polluted river stretches. Restoration of water bodies is also a connected issue which can be monitored by the same Committee atleast thrice a year at the national level. 22. Accordingly, we dispose of this application with following directions: (i) All States/UTs may forthwith designate a nodal agency for restoration of water bodies, wherever no such agency has so far been so designated. (ii) Under oversight of the Chief Secretaries of the States/UTs, the designated nodal agency may a. Hold its meeting not later than 31.1.2021 to take stock of the situation and plan further steps, including directions to District authorities for further course of action upto Panchayat levels and to evolve further monitoring mechanism as well Human Rights & Consumer Protection Cell... vs The State Of Telanganarep By Its Chief... on 14 March, 2022 as Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM). b. Submit periodical reports to the CPCB/Secretary Jal Shakti, Government of India. First such report may be furnished by 28.02.2021. (iii) The CMC for monitoring remediation of 351 polluted river stretches, headed by the Secretary, MoJS may monitor the steps for restoration of water bodies by all the States periodically, atleast thrice in a year. First such monitoring may take place by 31.3.2021.
