State Agro Industries 20 of 25 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:065705 CWP-9901-2023 (O&M). -21- 2023:PHHC:065705 Development Cooperation Vs. Johan Khan' reported as (2007) 10 SCC 88 that the power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is plenary in nature, not limited to any other provision of the Constitution. Prior exhaustion of alternate remedy is a rule of prudence and not of compulsion. In appropriate cases, the High Court may in its discretion, entertain the writ petition prior to availing alternative remedial measures. Some of the circumstances where the Hon'ble Supreme Court has upheld the maintainability of a writ petition despite existence of an alternative remedy are categorized as under: (i) Where the petitioner seeks to highlight the violation of fundamentalrights and press for enforcement of the same; or (ii) Where there is blatant violation of principles of natural justice; or (iii) Where the impugned order or action has been passed without jurisdiction; or Harmit Singh And Another vs State Of Punjab And Others on 8 May, 2023 (iv) Where the vires of the concerned Act itself have been assailed; or (v) Where the Court or the Tribunal against which the grievance is espoused lacks inherent jurisdiction; or (vi) Where the act in question suffers from blatant arbitrariness, discrimination, abuse of authority of power or disregards settled law; or (vii) Where the alternative remedy does not provide for the immediate, emergent or the interim relief that has been prayed for and in the absence of grant of such interim indulgence/emergent or immediate relief, the litigant suffers irreparable loss and injury or where the composition of the remedy renders it unfit for functioning. 16. In the absence of the circumstances noticed above, a writ jurisdiction would not be panacea for all the maladies which a litigant may suffer. It was 21 of 25 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:065705 CWP-9901-2023 (O&M). -22- 2023:PHHC:065705 also held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of 'Commissioner of Income Tax & Others Vs. Chhabil Dass Agarwal' reported as 2014 (1) SCC 603 that the High Court will not entertain a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution of India if an effective alternate remedy is available to the aggrieved person in the statute under which the action complained of has been taken or the statute itself contains a mechanism for a redressal of grievance and it still holds the field. Therefore, when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation. The burden lies on the person approaching the Writ Court to explain as to why,despite existence of a specialized statutory remedy, the High Court still ought to exercise its writ jurisdiction. 17. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Radha Krishan Industries Versus State of Himachal Pradesh and others, reported as (2021)6 SCC 771 held as under:- \"27. The principles of law which emerge are that : (i) The power under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue writs can be exercised not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but for any other purpose as well; (ii) The High Court has the discretion not to entertain a writ petition. One of the restrictions placed on the power of the High Court is where an effective alternate remedy is available to the aggrieved person; (iii) Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise where (a) the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of a fundamental right protected by Part III of the Constitution; (b) there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice; (c) the order or 22 of 25 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:065705 CWP-9901-2023 (O&M). -23- 2023:PHHC:065705 proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction; or (d) the vires of a legislation is challenged; Harmit Singh And Another vs State Of Punjab And Others on 8 May, 2023 (iv) An alternate remedy by itself does not divest the High Court of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution in an appropriate case though ordinarily, a writ petition should not be entertained when an efficacious alternate remedy is provided by law; (v) When a right is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that particular statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of statutory remedies is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion; and (vi) In cases where there are disputed questions of fact, the High Court may decide to decline jurisdiction in a writ petition. However, if the High Court is objectively of the view that the nature of the controversy requires the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, such a view would not readily be interfered with.\" 18. The circumstances of the present case fairly establish that there are no compelling circumstances on the basis whereof it may be held that the rights of the petitioner would be gravely prejudiced or defeated in case the writ Court does not intervene into the matter. I do not find any satisfactory reasons as to why the petitioner ought not exhaust their alternative remedy(ies) and prefer an appeal before the Appellate Authority under Section 127 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and the Regulations thereunder. 19. Undisputedly, the Regulations of 2016 are currently in force. Definition of complainant as provided therein, when read with the definition of complaint; consumer and consumer grievances clearly establish that a person who is desirous of release of a new electricity connection can also 23 of 25 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:065705 CWP-9901-2023 (O&M). -24- 2023:PHHC:065705 approach the Forum for redressal of his grievances including non-release of connection. Further, the consume complaint handling procedure under the above Regulations prescribe second priority to the grievance relating to release of connection under Clause 2.32. Such dispute is required to be examined and order is to be passed within 15 days of submission of such grievance. Some time period has also been prescribed for grievances. Power to grant interim order has also been vested under Regulation 2.46 thereof. Similar provisions have also been created for the Electricity Ombudsman and he too has been given power to issue interim orders under Regulation 3.23. Hence, it is evident that efficient and alternative dispute resolution procedure is duly provided under the Statute. 20 As a matter of fact, notwithstanding that the efficacious remedy has been prescribed under the Statutory Scheme, learned counsel for the petitioners has made an averment in the present petition that there is no other efficacious alternative remedy available to the petitioners except by means of filing the present petition in paragraph No.10 of the present petition. Such an averment which is not based on correct reference to the statutory provisions is clearly an attempt to mislead this Court. The non- Harmit Singh And Another vs State Of Punjab And Others on 8 May, 2023 disclosure of information including the statutory remedies available is clearly an attempt to mislead this Court and may be viewed as interference in the due process of administration of justice. 21 The position of law as regards entitlement of a citizen to seek electricity connection is not disputed. However, recognition/declaration of such a right does not also mean that jurisdiction under Article 226 of the 24 of 25 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:065705 CWP-9901-2023 (O&M). -25- 2023:PHHC:065705 Constitution of India, is the only remedy available in law and there is no need to take recourse to the Statutory remedy. 22 This court would ordinarily be inclined to impose heavy costs upon a litigant for concealing the aforesaid information and exhaustive grievance redressal mechanism. The petitioner was informed about the alternative remedies and conveyed about approaching the said Forum. However, the petitioner counsel insisted of complete absence of alternative remedy and for adjudication of his case on merits. Apart from the above remedy available under the Electricity Act, 2003, the grievance for release of electricity connection can also be raised before the Permanent Lok Adalat (Public Utility Services) under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987; the Right to Service Commission as well as under the Consumers Protection Act. Hence, numerous avenues, all conferred with power to issue interim orders are available to the petitioners. The insistence was thus not only misplaced but also undesired especially when a jurisdiction had already been pointed out to him. The present petition is accordingly dismissed, imposing a cost of Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand only) on the petitioners. The cost be deposited with the High Court Legal Services Committee, Chandigarh. 23 Dismissal of the petition would, however, not operate as a bar to the petitioners to take recourse to the Statutory remedies.
